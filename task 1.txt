Difference Between   HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2  

HTTP 1.1 

*  It was introduced in 1997 

*  It has features like CORS , kepp alive 

*  This will not allow multiplexing , which means , it allows only one request and response 
   over a single TCP connection .....
   for each request each TCP connection was created ....

*  header information is repeated with every request , like user agent , cookies , cache 
   it makes the request size large , and drawback back for fast response 

*  KEEP ALIVE  option enables Re-using of the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP request 
   but this will not the great relief , because we use new TCP connection for every request 



HTTP 2.0 or  HTTP 2

*  HTTP 2 was introduced in 2015 (  after http 1.1 version development it takes "18 years" to develop another update version )

*  This will do multiplexing , which means " one secured TCP connection is setup , In which http request are transferred in form of streams ....
   but complusory of TLS setup , because  HTTPS  is mandatory requirment 

  HPACK , header data (user agent , coolies , cache ) are seperated from request data and it can be ZIPPED 
  HPACK   also enable re-use of header data , which is repeated in every request 
  HPACK   it can reduce request size , perfomance speed also much faster

* PUSH   push frame enable server to send ( mandatory or addition related resource ) in advance , along with an http responce 
  push frame should be use with care ,as this can leads to increase the size of server http reponse
