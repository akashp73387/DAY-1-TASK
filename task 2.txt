                sister  = "trisa shankar"
            }
  }


// dot notation 
syntax ---- console.log(odjectname.key name);
console.log(person.age);


// square bracket notation ....key name inside square bracket must in single cotation
syntax ---- console.log(objectname['key name'])
console.log(person['age']);

//to acess key object
syntax ---- console.log(objectname.keyname.keyname)
console.log(person.siblings.brother)
